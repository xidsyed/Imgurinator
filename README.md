- **Custom Gesture Detector**: Implements swipe gestures for smooth navigation between media items.
- **ExoPlayer**: Handles video playback with adaptive streaming support.
- **Kotlin**: The primary programming language.
- **XML Views**: Used for creating UI components.
- **Moshi with Codegen**: For efficient JSON parsing.
- **Retrofit**: Handles network requests to fetch media data from Imgur.
- **Flows**: Kotlin Flows to read manage and update state.
